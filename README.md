PAST AND PRESENT OF COMPUTER 
The past and present of computers show a remarkable evolution in technology and functionality.<br>
PAST:<br>
1. Early Computers: The first computers were developed in the mid 20th century. Machines like ENIAC(1945) were massive, used vacuum tubes, and were primarily for military and scientific calculations.
2.  Transistors and Microprocessors: The invention of the transistor in the 1950s and later the microprocessor in the 1970s revolutionized computing. These advancements made computers smaller, more reliable, and more affordable.
3. Personal Computers: The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the rise of personal computers (PCs), with companies like Apple and IBM leading the way. This era made computing accessible to the general public.

Present:
1. Smart Devices: Today, computers are not just desktop PCs. They include laptops, tablets, and smartphones, all of which are powerful and portable. 
2. Cloud Computing: The rise of cloud technology allows users to store and access data over the internet, facilitating collaboration and remote work.
3. Artificial Intelligence: Modern computers leverage AI and machine learning, enabling them to perform complex tasks, analyze data, and even engage in conversations, like we're doing now!

Overall, the evolution from large, cumbersome machines to sleek, powerful devices has transformed how we live, work, and communicate.
